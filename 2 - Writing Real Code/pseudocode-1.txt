# Game Set-up
Declare 3 variable to hold the ship's position
Declare a variable to hold each of the user's guesses
Declare a variable which would count (accumulate/aggregate) all of the user's guesses
Declare a variable which would count all of the user's hits
Declare a variable which would signal when a ship has sunk

# Game Flow
WHILE ship isn't sunk
  GET the user's guess
  VALIDATE guess (compare user's guess to possible values)
  IF Guess isn't valid
    TELL the user and return to guess
  ELSE (Guess is valid)
    ADD 1 to guess counter
    IF guess is not a hit
      TELL the user and return to guess
    ELSE (guess is a hit)
      ADD 1 to hit counter
      IF the ship isn't sunk
        TELL the user and return to guess
      ELSE (the user has sunk the ship)
        SET isSunk to true
        TELL the user "You've sunk my battleship"
      END IF
    END IF
  END IF
END LOOP
TELL the user's score!

In the meantime we're using the browser's "prompt" functionality for getting the user's guesses input and the browser's "alert" functionality for telling the user about the progress.
